blink(1)  
========

"blink(1) is a super status light: it packs three dimensions of information 
(color, brightness and pattern) into a single tiny package that fits into 
any USB port on nearly every device. It makes it incredibly easy to connect 
any data source in the cloud or on your computer to a full-color RGB LED so 
you can know what's happening without checking any windows, going to any 
websites or typing any commands."
