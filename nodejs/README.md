### To use:
Install locally into your project (for Node 0.12)
```
% npm install node-blink1
```

### Node 4.x and node-blink1
As of 30 Sep 2015, node-hid has been patched by @lorenc-tomasz but it hasn't been merged
with mainline node-hid.  If you want to use node-blink1 with Node 4.x,
install this fork of node-hid before node-blink1:
```
% npm install 'https://github.com/lorenc-tomasz/node-hid.git#package'
% npm install node-blink1
```
