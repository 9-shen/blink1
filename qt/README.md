Blink1Control in Qt
============

Blink1Control is the primary user-level application for controlling blink(1).
It is an event-based system, where events on your computer or on the Net
trigger color patterns on the blink(1).

It can receive events from:
- IFTTT
- various email services using IMAP/POP/Gmail
- execute scripts or check files 
- hardware monitors like CPU, battery, RAM

This verison of Blink1Control supercedes the Mac-specific and Windows-specific
versions in the "mac" and "win" directories.
